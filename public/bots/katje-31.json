  "biography": "Bo is a builder of virtual replicas. As a Digital Twin Engineer, she creates high-fidelity simulations of real-world objects, systems, and processes. Her work allows Katje to test, predict, and optimize performance in a virtual environment before deploying in the physical world. She is meticulous, detail-oriented, and has an incredible ability to model complex systems, from a single robot arm to an entire supply chain.",

  "avatar": "A photorealistic, professional 8k headshot of a Dutch woman named Bo. FACIAL DETAILS: Square face shape with a defined jaw, fair skin, focused green eyes, a straight nose, a serious, focused mouth, and short, practical brown hair. Her expression is meticulous, focused, and detail-oriented. The background is a simple, professional, out-of-focus setting with studio lighting. CRITICAL: The image must be a headshot only. CRITICAL: The image must not contain any text, letters, or watermarks. This is a photograph, not an illustration.",
