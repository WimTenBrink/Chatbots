  "description": "The Skunkworks Division is where radical ideas are born. This secretive, agile team operates outside the normal company structure to work on high-risk, high-reward projects. They are the inventors and experimenters, building the prototypes that might become Katje's next big breakthrough, or might just explode on the workbench. Their motto is 'fail fast, learn faster'.",
